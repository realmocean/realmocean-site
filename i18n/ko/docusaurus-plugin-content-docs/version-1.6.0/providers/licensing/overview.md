## Innovative Licensing Solution

Appconda AppLicensing is a first-class solution in the Licensing as a Service (LaaS) sector.

Based on open standards, it provides a cost effective, integrated and scalable platform for software vendors and developers who want to concentrate on their product’s core functionality instead of spending resources on developing an own license management software.
AppLicensing allows vendors and developers to enable license management for their new or existing products right away and with minimum effort.

## An Ecosystem of Licensing Models

With AppLicensing you have a choice of ready-to-use licensing models or customized licensing models may be created to suit your unique business needs and goals.

Below are just a few examples of various license types that can be linked together to form a licensing model within the Appconda AppLicensing Ecosystem:

- Evaluation licenses
- Single-user licenses
- Time-limited licenses
- ‘Pay-per-use’ licenses
- ‘Pay-per-system’ licenses

## How it works

As a vendor, you need just three steps to integrate AppLicensing into your product. Once the product delivered to customers, the customers purchase their licenses directly at Appconda AppLicensing , without the need of further product vendor intervention. Payments for the licenses are credited directly to the account of the product vendor through the payment service built into Appconda services.

The following steps describe main integration and operation tasks:

1.  Plan: No matter if you already have a product or plan to create a new one, AppLicensing can be added at every stage. All you need is to clearly formulate your licensing needs.
2.  Setup: AppLicensing  is the integrated Appconda console  that allows you to control all licensing aspects of your products. Once you have decided on the licensing scheme, log in to AppLicensing Management Console and create desired licensing configuration. You can get back to AppLicensing Management Console at any time to alter your configuration or monitor the licenses. Besides, AppLicensing business intelligence module will consolidate your product usage information in regular reports.
3.  Integrate: Your product needs to communicate with AppLicensing in order to get the actual licensing information. Here comes AppLicensing Broker into play. With just a single request to AppLicensing Broker your software receives the complete licensing information for the specified customer. The licensing information is already processed and conveniently formed for direct use in your product’s business logic.

OPERATIONAL TASKS:

A. Deliver your product or service to customers, assigning a unique identity to each customer. This unique identity is referred as “Licensee Number”.

B. Using the assigned Licensee Number, your product will query via AppLicensing API (see Integration step 3) the actual licensing state of the customer.

C. Your product lets customers to visit AppLicensing for obtaining new licenses. Payment integrated in Appconda takes over the complexity of multiple individual monetary transactions.
