## What is a realm?

Realm is a work OS that powers developers to run apps. This is how realms enables teams and organizations to create custom solutions to manage their workflows. The options are infinite when you use the platform's API, components, brokers, integrations, automations, and more.

The Realm Ocean Framework allows developers to build new brokers, components and apps for realms.

## Who can create realms?

Any user can create realm and start offering third party applications on the app store or applications created by their own developers to their customers.

## Who can build apps?
Any developer can build apps using the **App Framework**. We built the framework to create apps independently of the **realms**.

The framework provides a set of components, services and tools to help you build your app easily, in order to let you focus on what matters.

## Who can use your apps?

The apps you create can be used by any organization or individual user in any realm. For this, it will be sufficient to download the relevant application from the app store.

You can create and install custom apps for your own realm account. Also, having the ability to integrate with other systems used by the organization and to create visuals and custom reports for your needs.

You can also make your app a public app that allows you to share it with the appconda community. You can create apps and sell them on your own or become a realm Partner and create apps as a service you offer to your customers.

We also have an app marketplace where other realm users can scan to install these third party apps. You can submit your app in our app store. For more information on submitting apps, check out our article Submitting Your App to the Apps Marketplace.
