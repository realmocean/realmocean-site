Appconda AppLicensing is sophisticated enough to cover even the most
outlandish licensing models: from single-user to network overflow
licenses. Appconda AppLicensing provides the software vendor with the
ability to map/combine numerous licensing models.

Licensing models combine different parameters that define how a product
can be used by the end user. AppLicensing offers you the flexibility to
assign multiple licensing models to your product, so you can create a
composite licensing model that is specific to your needs. With
AppLicensing you can define licensing models for specific customers,
geographies, business models, or any other criteria.

This table provides a description and configuration specifics for
licensing models supported by AppLicensing as well as some of the
possible licensing models and combinations that can be adopted by
AppLicensing.
