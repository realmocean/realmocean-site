# Collections
Contains interfaces and classes that define various collections of objects, such as lists, queues, bit arrays, hash tables and dictionaries.
## Classes
| Name                                 | Description                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [ArrayList]                                | Implements the IList interface using an array whose size is dynamically increased as required.  |
|[BitArray]| Manages a compact array of bit values, which are represented as Booleans, where true indicates that the bit is on (1) and false indicates the bit is off (0).|
|[CollectionBase]| Provides the abstract base class for a strongly typed collection. |
|[Comparer]|Compares two objects for equivalence, where string comparisons are case-sensitive. |
|[DictionaryBase]    | Provides the abstract base class for a strongly typed collection of key/value pairs.|
| [Hashtable]	                               | Represents a collection of key/value pairs that are organized based on the hash code of the key. |
| [Queue]	                               | Represents a first-in, first-out collection of objects. |
|[ReadOnlyCollectionBase]|Provides the abstract base class for a strongly typed non-generic read-only collection.|
|[SortedList]|Represents a collection of key/value pairs that are sorted by the keys and are accessible by key and by index.|
|[Stack]|Represents a simple last-in-first-out (LIFO) non-generic collection of objects.|
